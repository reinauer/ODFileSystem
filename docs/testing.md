# Testing Strategy

## Principles
- Most logic must be testable on host systems
- Every parser/backend must have direct tests
- Every bug fixed becomes a regression test
- Every supported format has golden images

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
Test small deterministic components: endian helpers, path parsing, timestamps, directory record parsing, cache logic, logging, charset conversion.

### Golden Image Tests (`tests/golden/`)
For each image, define expected: detected backend(s), volume name, root listing, file metadata, file hashes, timestamps.

### Malformed Image Tests (`tests/malformed/`)
Intentionally broken images to ensure: no crash, no infinite loop, graceful error paths, bounded resource usage.

### Differential Tests
Compare behavior against NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, CDVDFS. Differences documented as bug, intentional policy difference, or unsupported legacy quirk.

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
Test the AmigaDOS-facing handler: mount, list, read, examine, locks, path handling.

### Fuzz Targets (`tests/fuzz/`)
Host-side fuzz targets for each parser backend.

## Running Tests

```
make check    # build and run all unit tests
```

## CI Requirements
Per push: build, unit tests, golden image tests, malformed image tests, static checks, warnings-as-errors.
